Global warming akin to recent and projected trends last occurred over 17 million
years ago, when a 3-4Â°C gain occurred over 1,500,000 years. The current trend
will likely yeild comparable warming in 100 years. Historically, warming is
correlated with extinction, so this is really bad. This challenge presents a
tremendous opportunity for science to be employed across disciplinary boundaries
-- ranging from climatology to behavior change to public policy -- and in the
process prevent mass extinctions and human suffering. We don't yet have the
capacity to do this kind of science. I would like to collaborate with BIDS on
enabling this capacity. In the D-Lab, I'm developing tools and helping social
scientists gain skills that enable access to new sources of data and new methods
of analysis.  Working with a network of peers, I can rapidly iterate on
approaches that will help address climate change and other global challenges.
